### B04 - Caching

Caching is a technique for temporarily storing data so that frequently accessed information can be retrieved more quickly. By implementing caching, the load on the database can be reduced, and application performance can be improved.

In this project, Redis, a fast in-memory database that supports various data structures, is used to implement caching on the most frequently accessed database queries in the backend monolith service. The caching mechanism has been implemented using a custom `DynamicCacheInterceptor`, which caches responses based on query parameters and user-specific data.

#### Code Explanation

The `DynamicCacheInterceptor` is an interceptor that checks for cached responses before hitting the database. It constructs a unique cache key based on the request path, query parameters (`q`, `page`, `limit`), and optionally the user ID if available. If a cached response exists, it is returned immediately. Otherwise, the request proceeds, and the resulting response is cached for future use.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **CACHE_MANAGER Injection**: The interceptor injects the `CACHE_MANAGER`, which is an interface provided by `@nestjs/cache-manager` to interact with the Redis cache.
- **Cache Key Construction**: The cache key is dynamically constructed from the request path, query parameters, and user ID to ensure that different requests are cached separately.
- **Cache Lookup**: Before the request proceeds, the interceptor checks if the response for the given cache key already exists. If it does, the cached data is returned.
- **Response Caching**: If no cached response is found, the interceptor allows the request to proceed and then caches the response data for future requests.

#### Testing Caching Implementation

To test the caching implementation, you can:

1. **Request Timing**: Measure the time taken for a request with and without caching. The first request might take longer as it hits the database, while subsequent requests should be faster as they retrieve data from the cache.
2. **RedisInsight Inspection**: Use RedisInsight, a tool for visualizing and managing Redis data, to directly inspect the cached data in the Redis database. This allows you to see the cache entries and verify that the correct data is being stored.

This approach optimizes performance and reduces database load, ensuring faster data retrieval for end-users.
