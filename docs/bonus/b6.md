## B06 - Responsive Layout

I have implemented a responsive layout for the monolithic frontend of the application. Each page adapts to the user's device screen size, ensuring that the interface remains organized and aesthetically pleasing across various screen dimensions. This responsiveness has been applied throughout all pages in the frontend monolithic service, maintaining a clean and functional user experience regardless of the device used.
