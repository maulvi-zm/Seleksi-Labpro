## B10 Feature

In my project, I have implemented the following additional bonus features:

1. **Film Recommendation**: This feature provides personalized film recommendations based on previous purchases. The recommendation system considers the genre or director connections between films. If the user hasn't made any purchases, the system doesn't offer any recommendation.

2. **Rating + Review**: On the Film Details Page, users can rate films (1-5 stars) and leave reviews or comments. Users can also view ratings and reviews from others, helping them make informed decisions about which films to watch.

3. **Wishlist**: Users can add films to their Wishlist on the Film Details Page. This feature allows users to save films they are interested in for future purchases or viewing. Users can manage their Wishlist on a separate page, making it easier to keep track of films they want to watch later.
