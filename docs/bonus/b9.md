## B09 - Automated Testing

Automated testing has been implemented using Jest for unit testing. The focus of the testing is on the backend services layer, ensuring that the core business logic is thoroughly tested. The goal was to achieve at least 60% code coverage across the service layer, which has been met.

Tests can be executed using the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

This ensures that the functionality of the application is well-maintained, reducing the likelihood of bugs and making future development more efficient.
