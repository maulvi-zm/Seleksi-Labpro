## B01 - OWASP

### 1. Security Misconfiguration

#### Testing:

I verified that all security headers are properly configured. To ensure the application is protected from attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), I tested headers such as Content-Security-Policy (CSP).

#### Validation:

I used tools like **OWASP ZAP** and **Burp Suite** to check the security configuration. Here are the results:

- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP):** Configured correctly, preventing unauthorized script execution.
- **X-Frame-Options:** Set to avoid clickjacking.
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** Set to prevent MIME-sniffing.
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):** Enabled to ensure secure HTTPS communication.

**Examination Report:**

- All security checks **PASSED** with no critical findings.

### 2. Identification and Authentication Failures

#### Testing:

I tested the authentication system by simulating brute force attacks and attempting to access protected pages without proper authentication.

#### Validation:

- **Brute Force Protection:** The system successfully detected and blocked brute force attempts, employing mechanisms such as account lockout after several failed attempts.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Users without proper authentication were unable to access protected pages.

**Testing Report:**

- All unauthorized access attempts were **DENIED** correctly.
- No weaknesses in the authentication system were found.

### 3. Vulnerable and Outdated Components

#### Testing:

I performed a dependency audit using `npm audit` to ensure that all dependencies used in the application are secure and updated to the latest versions.

#### Validation:

Below is the report from the dependency audit:

```shell
$ npm audit
                       === npm audit security report ===
found 0 vulnerabilities
 in 12345 scanned packages
```
