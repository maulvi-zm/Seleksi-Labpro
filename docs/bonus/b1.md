### 1. Security Misconfiguration

#### Testing:

I verified that all security headers are properly configured. To ensure the application is protected from attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), I tested the application by performing XSS attack. The test is done by registering a user with a username that contains a script such `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. The attack is failed because all of the output in the application is escaped automatically by ejs when `<%= %>` is used.

### 1. Vulnerable and Outdated Components

#### Testing:

I performed a dependency audit using `npm audit` to ensure that all dependencies used in the application are secure and updated to the latest versions.

#### Validation:

Below is the report from the dependency audit:

```shell
$ npm audit
```
