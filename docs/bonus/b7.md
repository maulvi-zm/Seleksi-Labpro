## B07 - API Documentation

The API documentation for both the single service and monolith service in the backend has been created using `nestjs/swagger`. This documentation is accessible at the `/api` endpoint. It provides a detailed overview of all the available endpoints, their request parameters, and response formats, making it easier for developers to understand and interact with the API.
